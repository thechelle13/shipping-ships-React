# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
Revisiting React
Your skills and understand of React decay quickly now that you are learning Python and SQL. Therefore, it's time for each member of the team to build their own React client that works with the API that you just explored and augmented.

And there should be a navigation bar at the top of the screen with the following three links
